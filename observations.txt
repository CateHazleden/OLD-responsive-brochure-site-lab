My learning observations from this assignment:

    > Don't jump in before reading the assignment completely

    > The readme doc has the information!

    > Get the rubric for the assignment to keep me on track

    > Print out rubric and assignment to checklist each deliverable

    > STICK TO THE CHECKLIST
        - research only what is needed for the assignment
        - avoid going down rabbit-holes on unnecessary elements which is time that should be spent on deliverables
        - avoid sunk-cost mentalility; if intuition says to go simpler, listen! Even if it means starting again

Assignment observations:

    > MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN!!! (totally forgot about this in the excitement of building my first thing)

    > Full-screen first design meant: 
         - I'd created so much content, there was too much content to redesign in the time allocated before submission
         - it was really difficult to find all the breakpoints needed to make it mobile friendly (def did not achieve this)
         - some design functionality I was after may actually rely on JavaScript to function in the way intended?? Esp modals 

!!! Stick to the Keep It Simple Stupid design / build model !!!
